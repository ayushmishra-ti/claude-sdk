# Passage Reference (RL.*/RI.* Standards)

Guidelines and quality rules for generating reading passages for Reading Literature (RL.*) and Reading Informational (RI.*) standards.

---

## When Passage is Needed

- `RL.*` (Reading Literature) → Generate **narrative** passage
- `RI.*` (Reading Informational) → Generate **informational** passage
- Do NOT use for L.*, W.*, or other standards

---

## Passage Styles

### Narrative (RL.*)
- Stories, fables, folktales, myths
- Characters, plot, setting
- Beginning, middle, end structure
- Engaging story elements, age-appropriate themes

### Informational (RI.*)
- Articles, explanatory texts
- Facts and information
- Clear organization with main ideas
- Educational value

## Grade-Level Guidelines

| Grade | Age | Word Count | Sentence Style | Readability (FK) |
|-------|-----|------------|----------------|------------------|
| K | 5-6 | 50-100 | Very short (3-6 words) | 0-1 |
| 1 | 6-7 | 75-150 | Short (5-8 words) | 1-2 |
| 2 | 7-8 | 100-200 | Simple sentences | 2-3 |
| 3 | 8-9 | 150-250 | Simple/compound | 3-4 |
| 4 | 9-10 | 200-300 | Mix of structures | 4-5 |
| 5 | 10-11 | 250-350 | Varied structures | 5-6 |
| 6 | 11-12 | 300-400 | Complex allowed | 6-7 |
| 7 | 12-13 | 350-450 | Complex sentences | 7-8 |
| 8 | 13-14 | 400-500 | Varied complexity | 8-9 |
| 9-12 | 14-18 | 450-700 | Sophisticated/Advanced | 9-12+ |

## Quality Rules

### 1. Engagement
- **RL.* (Narrative)**: Clear arc (beginning, development, resolution), strong imagery, emotional payoff
- **RI.* (Informational)**: Surprising facts, meaningful connections, clear argument
- Avoid flat, purely expository prose without hooks

### 2. Topic Focus
- Single clear topic or theme
- Every paragraph serves the central focus
- No unrelated subplots or digressions

### 3. Narrative Coherence (RL.*)
- Character actions have logical motivations
- Timeline is consistent
- Cause-effect relationships are clear
- No plot holes or unexplained events

### 4. Argument Logic (RI.*)
- Claims supported by evidence
- Logical structure (problem-solution, cause-effect, compare-contrast)
- Conclusions follow from presented information

### 5. Literary Term Accuracy

**Critical**: Misusing literary terms causes factual accuracy failure.

| ❌ Misuse | ✅ Correct Usage |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Dramatic irony" for any surprise | Audience knows something characters don't |
| "Foreshadowing" for any early mention | Hints about FUTURE events specifically |
| "Symbolism" for any recurring element | Object/action represents abstract idea |
| "Metaphor" for any comparison | Direct comparison WITHOUT "like" or "as" |

## Standard-to-Question Mapping

| Standard Pattern | Question Focus |
|------------------|----------------|
| RL/RI.*.1 | Textual evidence, inference |
| RL/RI.*.2 | Theme, central idea, summary |
| RL/RI.*.3 | Character/event development, structure |
| RL/RI.*.4 | Word meaning in context |
| RL/RI.*.5 | Text structure analysis |
| RL/RI.*.6 | Point of view, purpose |

## Examples

### Grade 3 Narrative (RL.*)

```
The Little Seed

A tiny seed sat in the dark soil. "I wonder what I will become," it thought.

Day after day, the sun warmed the ground above. Rain soaked through the dirt. The seed began to change.

First, a small root pushed down into the earth. Then, a tiny green stem reached up toward the light. The stem grew taller and taller.

One morning, a beautiful flower opened its petals. The little seed had become a bright yellow sunflower!

"So this is what I was meant to be," the flower said, smiling at the sun.
```

### Grade 5 Informational (RI.*)

```
The Water Cycle

Water is always moving around our planet. This constant movement is called the water cycle, and it has been happening for billions of years.

The cycle begins when the sun heats water in oceans, lakes, and rivers. This heat turns liquid water into an invisible gas called water vapor. The process is called evaporation.

Water vapor rises into the sky and cools down. When it gets cold enough, the vapor turns back into tiny water droplets. These droplets join together to form clouds. This step is called condensation.

When clouds hold too much water, the droplets fall back to Earth as rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Scientists call this precipitation.

The water that falls collects in rivers, lakes, and oceans. Some soaks into the ground. Then the cycle starts all over again.
