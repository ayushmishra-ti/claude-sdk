# ELA Grammar Constraints for L.* Standards

Specialized constraints for Language (L.*) standards ensuring grammatical accuracy and single-answer validity.

## When to Use

- Standard ID contains `L.` (e.g., `CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.3.1.A`)

## Required Action

**BEFORE writing any grammar question:**

1. **Read** `.claude/reference/grammar-rules.md`
2. Find the section for this grade/topic
3. **Verify your explanation** against the rules before finalizing

The reference contains:
- Grade-specific grammar focus (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-12)
- Detailed rules for verbals, voice, mood, tenses, punctuation
- Common factual errors to avoid (gerund vs progressive, subjunctive, etc.)
- Correct terminology

## Quality Rules

1. **Explanation accuracy** — must match grammar-rules.md; use proper terminology
2. **Stem-option alignment** — if stem asks about "verbals," options should be verbals (don't mix categories)
3. **Single answer** — exactly ONE grammatically correct answer; distractors clearly wrong
4. **Distractor design** — base on common student errors (see reference for examples by skill)

## Checklist

Before returning an L.* question:
- [ ] Read `.claude/reference/grammar-rules.md` for this topic
- [ ] Explanation is factually correct per reference
- [ ] Proper terminology used
- [ ] Stem and options aligned (same grammar category)
- [ ] Only ONE answer is grammatically valid
- [ ] Distractors reflect real student misconceptions
